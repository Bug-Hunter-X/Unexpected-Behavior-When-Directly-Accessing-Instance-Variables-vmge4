# Unexpected Behavior When Directly Accessing Instance Variables in Ruby

This example demonstrates a potential issue when directly modifying instance variables in Ruby. While it works, it bypasses the intended access mechanisms of the class and can lead to maintenance and debugging problems.

The solution shows how to use methods to access and modify instance variables, promoting better encapsulation and code structure.
